# bornacheck.github.io
[bornacheck.github.io](https://bornacheck.github.io) is a website all about me and my projects.

It has a Fluent design, from many of Microsoft's products. In the source code (the styling), many classes relating to pure controls are prefixed with `winui`.

Furthermore, each page has its own directory that stores all the resources (the markdown content, if any,
the content resources such as images, the shell page, and the extra page metadata).
The root page stores all its resources in the root directory.

The resource directory system is still in development, as there is minimal content in [bornacheck.github.io](https://bornacheck.github.io).
